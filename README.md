# MineBuild
MineBuild is an open source game engine in which you can make simple games and mine+build. On an average system, this program would use 1.4GiB. It uses a simple Unity-based system to mimic 3D simulations. The animations will be shown on the MineBuild app for Windows. To open the MineBuild app, you need to download MineBuild from our website. [Click to Download](?message). But in the case that you can't download MineBuild, you can instead use MineBuild online. It does not support the type of Unity Gaming that the app does, so you might not really want to use that. If your computer is managed by someone else, who has admin or application management access, contact them.
